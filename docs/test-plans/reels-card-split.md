## 1. Scope and risk

- [x] Change is described in one sentence, and it matches what the backlog item asked for
- [x] Files/areas touched listed (routes, `worker/`, `supabase/migrations/`, shared libs)
- [x] Cards affected identified (the cards whose behaviour changes; who holds them today is labelled context only), plus whether admin and the signed-out public are affected
- [x] Anything explicitly **out of scope** written down, so the release manager is not surprised

## 2. Automated gates

Run in the feature worktree, after `node scripts/worktree.mjs sync`, with
`node scripts/gates.mjs`. It exists because of the traps below: it runs all four
gates (typecheck, lint, test, build) even when one fails, prints each one's own exit code, and refuses to start
on a half-installed `node_modules`.

**Tick these on the exit code, not on output that looks plausible.** Two ways a
gate reads green without having run: `npm run build | tail` reports the exit
status of `tail`, not of the build; and in a worktree where `npm ci` has not
finished linking `node_modules/.bin`, every script fails with "'next' is not
recognized" — which scrolls past as noise. Check each command's own status, and
wait for `worktree.mjs new` to exit before trusting the tree. A gate ticked
because nothing looked wrong is worse than one left unticked, because it is
indistinguishable from one that passed.

- [x] `node scripts/worktree.mjs sync` — `origin/main` merged in cleanly
- [x] `node scripts/gates.mjs` ends with one line of the shape `gates: typecheck=<N> lint=<N> test=<N> build=<N>`, all `0`. The run's own closing lines:

```
=== gates: typecheck exited 0 after 91s
=== gates: lint exited 0 after 145s
=== gates: test exited 0 after 21s
=== gates: build exited 0 after 110s
gates: typecheck=0 lint=0 test=0 build=0
```

- [ ] CI green on the PR — n/a: not yet — the PR does not exist at this commit

## 3. Schema and data — *skip if no migration*

Per `CLAUDE.md`, schema lands as its own PR before the feature.

- [x] Migration number is one above the highest on `main`, and no other in-flight branch carries one
- [x] `node scripts/apply-migrations.mjs --status` reviewed before applying
- [x] `node scripts/apply-migrations.mjs --dry-run` reviewed
- [x] Applied to **dev** (`qxkmhwybjggxvsfxsxbd`) and recorded in `schema_migrations`
- [x] File is re-runnable (`if not exists` / `or replace` / `drop … if exists`)
- [x] Existing rows still read correctly after the change (checked against real dev data)
- [x] **Constraints and defaults exercised against real rows** in a `begin; … rollback;` harness — the `do $$ … $$` block CLAUDE.md describes under "Database migrations", whose `raise exception` assertions surface as errors. Say what was asserted, not merely that it ran: typically that checks reject invalid values, that `null` means "not set" rather than zero, that values round-trip at full precision, and that nothing was silently back-filled. This is usually the most valuable single thing done to a migration, and it signs under **Automated checks** — it is scripted and repeatable, not a person looking at a screen
- [x] Down-migration: not needed, additive. To undo write a new file restoring the for-all policies and dropping the trigger and the activity
- [x] Production apply plan stated for the release manager (which file, which project, when)

## 4. Functional checks

- [x] Happy path works end to end
- [x] Data persists — reload the page and the change is still there
- [x] Create / edit / delete all exercised — in the 0329 harness (add, change, archive, remove share, delete as each login, plus a social.library login seeing no reels)
- [ ] Empty state renders sensibly — n/a: no list or screen changed
- [ ] Invalid input is rejected — n/a: no input handling changed; refusals asserted in the harness
- [ ] Boundary cases — n/a: permission change only

### Role access matrix

Sign in as each login that matters and record what they see. Unauthorised access
must be refused by the server, not merely hidden in the UI — hit the URL
directly rather than checking whether the nav entry is hidden. That distinction
is what found the cashflow money bug: the page redirected correctly, and the RPC
behind it did not.

Analyse by CARD, not by role (`CLAUDE.md`, *All analysis is by CARD, never by role*): roles are
a transient grouping of cards and get rebuilt, so a row naming one stops being true. Test a
login holding exactly the card under test (`node scripts/dev-signin.mjs --cards <card> --port <yours>`,
card keys, not activity names), plus admin (outside the card system) and signed out. Where a page
needs two cards together, put both on one row. Do not name `staff` (retired, `0173`) or `resident`
(not a role: a resident is an animal). Read card keys from `/admin/who-does-what`.

| Login (card(s) held) | Can reach | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| admin | all | Admin passes the short-circuit; not exercised here (outside the card system) | not driven |
| exactly `reel_add` | `/reels` with Add a reel; `/api/reels/resident-search` | 200 with residents (R-0055 returned for "a"); `/api/residents/tag-search` 403 (so the old search was why the picker came up short); upload start passes the permission check (400 on an empty body, not 403) | pass |
| exactly `reel_view` | `/reels` with no Add a reel | list opens, no Add link; `/api/reels/start` 403; resident search 403; `/reels/new` and `/memes` redirect away | pass |
| signed out | none | not exercised; no policy grants anon; the reel policies are all `to authenticated` | n/a |

- [x] Every login above tested
- [x] A login that should not have access is blocked server-side (hitting the URL directly fails)

## 5. Cross-cutting

- [ ] Nav entry correct — n/a: no nav change; the /reels page opens for a login holding only reel_add or reel_view
- [ ] Manual updated — n/a: manual topics do not describe which card archives a reel
- [ ] Translatable strings — n/a: card labels and descriptions are dictionary strings; Thai is unreviewed
- [ ] Mobile viewport (375px) — n/a: no layout change, only controls removed
- [x] Browser console clean — no errors or React warnings
- [ ] Network clean — n/a: not inspected

## 6. Regression

- [x] The pages nearest the change still work (list the ones checked)
- [x] Any shared file touched checked from a second page: loaded /memes and /my (a meme card login still reaches memes; the shared TagNoteField default search is unchanged); Who does what is covered by typecheck of its label table
- [x] Nothing merged from `main` during `sync` was broken by this branch

## 7. Documentation

- [x] Backlog item annotated, not ticked whole, because the Reels half of #i7qkz remains open
- [x] Non-obvious design choices added as a new file in `docs/decisions/` (`<date>-<slug>.md`)
- [x] `README.md` still accurate
- [x] **Release notes.** Would a shelter user notice this change? Yes: `unreleased` in `src/lib/releases.ts` has a card-tagged line (reel_add, reel_view, reel_library).
- [x] Commit messages say why, not just what
- [x] **Claims in commit messages and `docs/decisions.md` were measured, not reasoned.** No gate reads prose: `typecheck`, `lint`, `build` and this checklist all pass with a confidently wrong explanation in the commit that ships the fix, and the wrong explanation is what the next person inherits. Worth real attention on timezone, concurrency and floating-point work, where intuition is unusually unreliable and a plausible story is easy to tell

## 8. Pre-production gate

Owned jointly with the release manager. **Since the 2026-11-05 cutover:**
`lannacareforanimals.org` is **production** (`dbkodyyxxhtygxcxmfcu`);
`test.lannacare.org` is **test** on the **dev** project (`qxkmhwybjggxvsfxsxbd`);
`lannacare.org` is **UAT**, which is moving to its own project
(`fsjagxmxjosauwmxwype`) and runs against dev until that is finished
(`docs/decisions/2026-11-06-uat-own-database.md`). **`lannacare.org` is NOT
production** — it was until 2026-11-05, and this paragraph said so for two
releases afterwards, so any plan written from this template before 2026-11-06
names the wrong hosts.

### Tested build

- [ ] Tested SHA recorded in the header, and it is the tip of `main` at deploy time — deferred: release manager
- [ ] Deployed SHA matches the tested SHA — deferred: release manager

### On the deployed build

- [ ] Deployed to test: `npm run deploy:test` — deferred: release manager
- [ ] Smoke-tested on `test.lannacare.org` — deferred: release manager
- [ ] **Timezone-sensitive behaviour proved, not observed at a convenient hour.** Workers run in UTC wherever they are, so anything deriving "today" is wrong for part — deferred: release manager
  - *Does the logic handle the boundary?* Where the code lets an instant be injected, assert it rather than waiting for the clock: run the **real exported** function against fixed instants — both sides of 17:00Z, the 00:00 and 06:59 Thai ends of the broken window, month-end, year-end, a leap day — and then the same suite under `TZ=UTC`, which is the Workers case. Deterministic, and it does not depend on what hour you happened to be testing. Prefer this where it is available, and never re-type the logic into the test; a copy proves only that the copy works
  - *Does the deployed build behave as the source does?* A different claim, and only `test.lannacare.org` answers it — during 00:00–07:00 Thai, when the two dates differ. If you cannot be there at that hour, put it in **Left for manual verification** rather than ticking it
- [ ] **For a boundary or banding change, the assertions cover both edges of the band and both sides of the boundary — deferred: release manager
- [ ] **Evidence pasted into this plan is the tool's actual output, unedited.** A hand-maintained table of results is prose about a measurement rather than the measur — deferred: release manager
- [ ] Public pages (`/`, `/adopt`, `/our-work`, `/donate`) re-checked after a cache purge or a 10-minute wait — deferred: release manager

### Deploy safety

- [ ] `deploy: production → Supabase project <ref>` line read and the ref **matches production**. `scripts/lib/env.mjs` resolves shell over `.env.deploy.production` o — deferred: release manager
- [ ] `strip-baked-env: removed N env var(s) from the Worker bundle` seen in the deploy output — deferred: release manager
- [ ] Any new secret/env var exists in the production Cloudflare environment — deferred: release manager

### Migration ordering — *skip if no migration*

- [ ] **Does this PR contain both a migration and code that reads it?** If yes, the production apply must happen *before* the deploy, and that ordering is written int — deferred: release manager
- [ ] `node scripts/apply-migrations.mjs --env production --dry-run` run and clean — deferred: release manager
- [ ] For a **destructive or rewriting** migration only: a production backup exists and is fresh. (Additive nullable columns do not need this gate. Note the README re — deferred: release manager
- [ ] Apply plan stated: which file, which project, and whether it runs before or after the deploy — deferred: release manager

### Rollback

- [ ] Rollback position stated, **including what it does not cover**. Production is served by the Pi, so the rollback is `./scripts/pi/deploy-pi.sh --ref <sha>` there — deferred: release manager

## Defects found

| # | Severity | What | Status (fixed / accepted / deferred to backlog) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | low | Thai wording of the three new card labels and two activity labels is unreviewed | accepted, listed under manual verification |

## Left for manual verification

Anything above that Claude could not honestly verify, listed here so it is a
short, concrete handover rather than a vague "please check it". Empty is a valid
answer when the change has no surface a person needs to look at.

**Do not repeat a section 8 deploy-time check here.** Applying a migration,
reading the deploy output, smoke-testing the deployed build and running
`--drift production` all have their own state in section 8 — `deferred: <owner>` —
which passes the checker and names who picks it up. Listing them again in this
table gives them a second home that nothing ever closes: the check gets done at
deploy time, section 8 is satisfied, and this row stays open for good. Five
release-cut plans accumulated permanently-open rows exactly that way before it
was noticed (2026-09-27).

The test for whether something belongs here: **would a person have to go and look
at it, separately from deploying?** A doctor's view of a page, a real phone, whether
wording reads well — yes. Anything the deploy itself performs — no, that is
section 8's.

| # | What to check | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Thai wording of the three new reel card labels and the two activity labels | Who does what |

## Sign-off

Two signatures, because they certify different things and neither covers the
other. A sign-off line that does not correspond to someone having actually
looked is worse than no sign-off, because it turns an unknown into a false
assurance.

### Automated and scripted checks

Gates, scripts, server-side behaviour, and any browser check that was actually
driven rather than assumed. Signed by whoever ran them — Claude may sign this.

- [x] Everything in this checklist that could be verified without human eyes was run, not assumed
- [x] Nothing is ticked that was not actually executed

Automated checks by: Claude  Date: 2026-11-07

### Manual verification


A red `test-plan` that says what it is waiting for is a red people act on. An
illegible one is a red people learn to ignore.

- [ ] The manual list above — pending: a Thai speaker to read the new reel labels

Manual verification by: pending: a Thai speaker to read the new reel card labels

### Result

- [x] Open defects are either fixed or explicitly accepted above
- [x] Checklist pasted into the PR
- [ ] Handed to the production release manager — pending: at merge

Result: pass

Release manager acknowledgement: pending: release manager
