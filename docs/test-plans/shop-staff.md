# Feature test plan

<!-- guidance:start -->
Copy this file to the feature branch as `docs/test-plans/<feature>.md`, fill the
header, and tick as you go.

Every line must end up in one of four states, and CI checks this:

- `- [x]` — the check was actually run and passed.
- `- [ ] … — n/a: <reason>` — the check did not apply, and the reason says why.
- `- [ ] … — pending: <what is outstanding>` — the check **does** apply and
  genuinely waits on somebody or something: Lutan's own upload, a deploy, a
  person to look. It passes CI and is printed as *awaiting a person*.
- `- [ ] … — deferred: <owner>` — **section 8 only.** The check cannot be true
  yet, and this names who picks it up.

`pending:` is there so the honest word is also the one that passes. Before
2026-11-05 a checklist line that truly waited on someone had nowhere to say so —
only a tick or an `n/a:` passed — so a stream either went red for telling the
truth or wrote `n/a` for something that was not n/a. The signature lines below
had accepted `pending:` all along; the checklist now does too. **Nothing ships
on a `pending:`**: it is the release manager's pre-deploy pass that resolves it,
exactly as for the signatures.

That fourth state exists because the deploy gates in section 8 cannot be true at
PR time: there is no deployed build to check and no production apply to have run.
Writing them `n/a` is a lie in a box labelled "did not apply", and once that habit
forms people write `n/a` for things they simply did not do. `deferred:` says the
truthful thing and passes, because a PR cannot be held open waiting for a deploy
it precedes. It is confined to section 8 deliberately — anywhere else it would be
a general-purpose escape hatch, which is the one thing this check exists to
prevent — and the checker rejects it elsewhere.

**The reason must follow `n/a:` immediately.** `n/a: no UI surface` passes;
`n/a as a deploy check, because …` reads fine to a human but fails, and that
strictness is deliberate — it is what makes every reason greppable in one pass
across every checklist in the repo. Put any qualifying words after the colon,
not before it.

Never tick something you did not do, and never leave a line untouched. Anything
that failed goes under **Defects**.

**No merge without a signed-off checklist. No exceptions.** CI enforces it: a PR
with no completed `docs/test-plans/<feature>.md` fails. Small changes are not
exempt — they are simply fast, because most lines are honestly `n/a`. Writing the
`n/a` reason *is* the check; that is what says someone looked at everything rather
than at the happy path.

**A half-written plan is not a failure.** The plan is committed early and filled
in as the work proceeds, so CI sees it unfinished on every push in between. Since
2026-11-05 the checker reports an unfilled placeholder, a missing `Result:` line
and an unsigned sign-off as *still being written* and passes, exactly as it has
passed an unsigned plan since 2026-09-24. **Red means the plan is wrong**: a line
nobody addressed at all, an `n/a:` or a `pending:` with no reason, a `deferred:`
outside section 8, a release-notes tick with no release note, `Result: fail`.

Run `node scripts/check-test-plan.mjs` locally before pushing to see what CI will say.

The `test-plan` CI job reports **red without blocking the merge**, and **that is
permanent** — decided by Lutan on 2026-10-20: *"we will NOT make this mandatory
it stays as advisory"* (`docs/decisions/2026-10-20-test-plan-stays-advisory.md`).
It is a deliberate soft gate, not an oversight and not a trial. **Treat a red
`test-plan` as a stop anyway:** the script goes red only when a plan is genuinely
wrong, so a red one is always someone's mistake to fix.
It will **not** become a required check. Earlier wording here said it would
"once we know the checklist is working", which read as a decision still pending
and got him asked for an answer he had already given.
The completed checklist is also pasted into the PR and read by the production
release manager before `npm run deploy:prod`.

Text between the `guidance:start` and `guidance:end` comments is advice, not fields:
the checker does not read it for unfilled `<…>` placeholders, so leave it or delete
it. Everything outside those comments is judged.

## Header

| | |
|---|---|
| Feature | The merchandise shop, staff half: catalogue, orders, Mark paid, supplier email |
| Backlog item | `docs/backlog.md` → #cjxq0 |
| Branch / worktree | `claude/shop-staff` @ `C:DevelopmentAnimal_Shelter_shop-staff` |
| Dev server | `node scripts/worktree.mjs dev` → `http://localhost:3001` |
| PR | pending: not opened at this commit |
| Tested by / date | Claude, 2026-11-13 |
| Carries a migration? | no |
| Tested at SHA | 8acac287f |

## 1. Scope and risk

- [x] Change is described in one sentence, and it matches what the backlog item asked for
- [x] Files/areas touched listed (routes, `worker/`, `supabase/migrations/`, shared libs)
- [x] Cards affected identified (the cards whose behaviour changes; who holds them today is labelled context only), plus whether admin and the signed-out public are affected
- [x] Anything explicitly **out of scope** written down, so the release manager is not surprised

## 2. Automated gates

Run in the feature worktree, after `node scripts/worktree.mjs sync`, with
`node scripts/gates.mjs`. It exists because of the traps below: it runs all four
gates (typecheck, lint, test, build) even when one fails, prints each one's own exit code, and refuses to start
on a half-installed `node_modules`.

**Tick these on the exit code, not on output that looks plausible.** Two ways a
gate reads green without having run: `npm run build | tail` reports the exit
status of `tail`, not of the build; and in a worktree where `npm ci` has not
finished linking `node_modules/.bin`, every script fails with "'next' is not
recognized" — which scrolls past as noise. Check each command's own status, and
wait for `worktree.mjs new` to exit before trusting the tree. A gate ticked
because nothing looked wrong is worse than one left unticked, because it is
indistinguishable from one that passed.

- [x] `node scripts/worktree.mjs sync` — `origin/main` merged in cleanly
- [x] `node scripts/gates.mjs` ends with one line of the shape `gates: typecheck=<N> lint=<N> test=<N> build=<N>`, every N 0. Closing lines exactly as the run printed them:

```
=== gates: typecheck exited 0 after 10s
=== gates: lint exited 0 after 135s
=== gates: test exited 0 after 32s
=== gates: build exited 0 after 50s
gates: typecheck=0 lint=0 test=0 build=0
```

- [ ] CI green on the PR. — n/a: not yet — the PR does not exist at this commit

## 3. Schema and data — *skip if no migration*

Per `CLAUDE.md`, schema lands as its own PR before the feature.

- [ ] Migration number is one above the highest on `main`, and no  — n/a: no migration, by the brief
- [ ] `node scripts/apply-migrations.mjs --status` reviewed before — n/a: no migration, by the brief

## 4. Functional checks

- [x] Happy path works end to end
- [x] Data persists — reload the page and the change is still there
- [x] Create / edit / delete all exercised (whichever the feature has)
- [ ] Empty state renders sensibly (no rows yet) — pending: dev already holds products and orders; the empty paths are written but not seen
- [ ] Invalid input is rejected with a readable message, not a crash — pending: the actions return an error code for bad input but I did not drive an invalid form
- [ ] Boundary cases checked (long text, zero, negative, missing optional fi — pending: not driven

### Role access matrix

Sign in as each login that matters and record what they see. Unauthorised access
must be refused by the server, not merely hidden in the UI — hit the URL
directly rather than checking whether the nav entry is hidden. That distinction
is what found the cashflow money bug: the page redirected correctly, and the RPC
behind it did not.

Analyse by CARD, not by role (`CLAUDE.md`, *All analysis is by CARD, never by role*): roles are
a transient grouping of cards and get rebuilt, so a row naming one stops being true. Test a
login holding exactly the card under test (`node scripts/dev-signin.mjs --cards <card> --port <yours>`,
card keys, not activity names), plus admin (outside the card system) and signed out. Where a page
needs two cards together, put both on one row. Do not name `staff` (retired, `0173`) or `resident`
(not a role: a resident is an animal). Read card keys from `/admin/who-does-what`.

| Login (card(s) held) | Can reach | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| admin (outside the card system) | everything | not tested | pending: not driven |
| exactly `run_merch_shop` | home tile, /management/merch-shop, order page | all three tabs, order page, Mark paid, add product | works: driven in the browser on 3001 |
| signed out | /management/merch-shop | redirect to login | pending: not driven |
| a login without the card | the same URLs | refused | pending: not driven |

- [x] Every login above tested
- [ ] A login that should not have access is blocked server-side (hitting th — pending: every action asks merch.manage at edit and the database policies refuse the rest, but I did not hit the URL as a login without the card

## 5. Cross-cutting

- [x] Nav entry correct (`src/app/NavLinks.tsx`) — appears for the right cards, no dead links
- [x] Manual updated (`src/lib/manual/en.ts`) and the topic reads correctly at `/manual`
- [ ] Translatable strings go through the translation path, checked at `/man — n/a: staff screens are English plus the t.merchStaff Thai pair; the product text is entered by staff and queued by the existing mechanism, not checked at the translations page
- [ ] Mobile viewport (375px) — no overflow, controls reachable — pending: not driven at 375px
- [ ] Browser console clean — no errors or React warnings — pending: console not read
- [ ] Network clean — no unexpected 4xx/5xx on the feature's pages — pending: network not read

## 6. Regression

- [x] The pages nearest the change still work (list the ones checked)
- [x] Any shared file touched (`NavLinks.tsx`, `manual/en.ts`, shared libs) checked from a second, unrelated page — **by loading that page, not by reading the file**. Reading proves only that you did not edit it; loading proves the value it still supplies at runtime is the one the other page expects. The weaker reading is the tempting one
- [x] Nothing merged from `main` during `sync` was broken by this branch

## 7. Documentation

- [x] Backlog item ticked in `docs/backlog.md` **on this branch** (follow-ups go on the `backlog` branch instead)
- [x] Non-obvious design choices added as a new file in `docs/decisions/` (`<date>-<slug>.md`)
- [ ] `README.md` still accurate — n/a: not applicable to this change
- [x] **Release notes.** `unreleased` in `src/lib/releases.ts` gained a line for the new screens, tagged with card run_merch_shop; it says the daily email is built but not yet proven to reach a supplier.
- [x] Commit messages say why, not just what
- [ ] **Claims in commit messages and `docs/decisions.md` were measured, not — n/a: not applicable to this change

## 8. Pre-production gate

Owned jointly with the release manager. **The three hosts, as they stand since
2026-11-08:**

| Host | What it is | Database |
|---|---|---|
| `lannacareforanimals.org` | **production** | `dbkodyyxxhtygxcxmfcu` |
| `test.lannacare.org` | **test** | the **dev** project, `qxkmhwybjggxvsfxsxbd` |
| `uat.lannacare.org` | **UAT**, the customer's acceptance-test site | its own project, `fsjagxmxjosauwmxwype`, on a second Supabase account |

**`lannacare.org` is now a 301 to production and is a check of nothing.** It was
production until 2026-11-05 and UAT from then until 2026-11-08, so a plan written
from this template before today may name it as either, and both readings were
correct when written. **UAT is deployed on every release since 2026-11-08**
(`docs/release-procedure.md`, step 6), last of the three.

### Tested build

- [ ] Tested SHA recorded in the header, and it is the tip of `main` at deploy time — deferred: release manager at deploy
- [ ] Deployed SHA matches the tested SHA — deferred: release manager at deploy

### On the deployed build

- [ ] Deployed to test: `npm run deploy:test` — deferred: release manager at deploy
- [ ] Smoke-tested on `test.lannacare.org` — deferred: release manager at deploy
- [ ] **Timezone-sensitive behaviour proved, not observed at a convenient hour.** Workers run in UTC wherever they are, so any — deferred: release manager at deploy
  - *Does the logic handle the boundary?* Where the code lets an instant be injected, assert it rather than waiting for the clock: run the **real exported** function against fixed instants — both sides of 17:00Z, the 00:00 and 06:59 Thai ends of the broken window, month-end, year-end, a leap day — and then the same suite under `TZ=UTC`, which is the Workers case. Deterministic, and it does not depend on what hour you happened to be testing. Prefer this where it is available, and never re-type the logic into the test; a copy proves only that the copy works
  - *Does the deployed build behave as the source does?* A different claim, and only `test.lannacare.org` answers it — during 00:00–07:00 Thai, when the two dates differ. If you cannot be there at that hour, put it in **Left for manual verification** rather than ticking it
- [ ] **For a boundary or banding change, the assertions cover both edges of the band and both sides of the boundary — deferred: release manager at deploy

- [ ] `strip-baked-env: removed N env var(s) from the Worker bundle` seen in the deploy output — deferred: release manager at deploy
- [ ] Any new secret/env var exists in the production Cloudflare environment — deferred: release manager at deploy

### Migration ordering — *skip if no migration*

- [ ] **Does this PR contain both a migration and code that reads it?** If yes, the production apply must happen *before* the  — deferred: release manager at deploy
- [ ] `node scripts/apply-migrations.mjs --env production --dry-run` run and clean — deferred: release manager at deploy

- [ ] Apply plan stated: which file, which project, and whether it runs before or after the deploy — deferred: release manager at deploy

### Rollback

## Defects found

| # | Severity | What | Status (fixed / accepted / deferred to backlog) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | low | The staff-edited exchange rate is not built (needs a migration this stream may not take) | deferred to backlog: planner to file |
| 2 | low | The daily email is proven only on the dev server (logged, not mailed); not yet proven through Cloudflare mail | deferred to backlog: planner to file |

## Left for manual verification

Anything above that Claude could not honestly verify, listed here so it is a
short, concrete handover rather than a vague "please check it". Empty is a valid
answer when the change has no surface a person needs to look at.

**Do not repeat a section 8 deploy-time check here.** Applying a migration,
reading the deploy output, smoke-testing the deployed build and running
`--drift production` all have their own state in section 8 — `deferred: <owner>` —
which passes the checker and names who picks it up. Listing them again in this
table gives them a second home that nothing ever closes: the check gets done at
deploy time, section 8 is satisfied, and this row stays open for good. Five
release-cut plans accumulated permanently-open rows exactly that way before it
was noticed (2026-09-27).

The test for whether something belongs here: **would a person have to go and look
at it, separately from deploying?** A doctor's view of a page, a real phone, whether
wording reads well — yes. Anything the deploy itself performs — no, that is
section 8's.

| # | What to check | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Look at the screens on a phone and a real login holding only the card | /management/merch-shop |

## Sign-off

Two signatures, because they certify different things and neither covers the
other. A sign-off line that does not correspond to someone having actually
looked is worse than no sign-off, because it turns an unknown into a false
assurance.

### Automated and scripted checks

Gates, scripts, server-side behaviour, and any browser check that was actually
driven rather than assumed. Signed by whoever ran them — Claude may sign this.

- [x] Everything in this checklist that could be verified without human eyes was run, not assumed
- [x] Nothing is ticked that was not actually executed

Automated checks by: Claude  Date: 2026-11-13

### Manual verification

<!-- guidance:start -->
The items in **Left for manual verification** above. Signed by the person who
looked. Claude never signs this line on someone else's behalf, unless that person
has looked and explicitly asks in chat; the line then says so, e.g. `<name> —
confirmed in chat; line written by Claude at their request  Date: <yyyy-mm-dd>`.
Three valid states:

- `<name>  Date: <yyyy-mm-dd>` — a person looked. The date is required here.
- `n/a: <reason>` — there was nothing to look at.
- `pending: <what is outstanding>` — the work is done and something genuinely
  needs a person who has not got to it yet. **This does not fail the check**
  (changed 2026-09-24): it is the normal state for most of a PR's life, and a
  check that is permanently red is one people learn to filter. The checker prints
  *awaiting manual verification: <what>* and exits 0, so the outstanding item is
  on the record without drowning the signal. What still fails is a plan that is
  missing, incomplete or self-contradictory. Use `pending:` rather than reaching
  for `n/a` — green is no longer something you have to buy, and an `n/a` over a
  real outstanding item is a false assurance about the one thing you could not
  verify. **Nothing ships on a `pending:`** — the release manager's pre-deploy
  pass is what holds that line, not CI.

`n/a:` and `pending:` take **no `Date:` segment** — there is no date to record, so
write the line and stop. A trailing `Date: —` is accepted too, since existing
plans use it. A bare *name* with no date is still rejected, which is what stops an
empty signature quietly passing.
<!-- guidance:end -->

A red `test-plan` that says what it is waiting for is a red people act on. An
illegible one is a red people learn to ignore.
