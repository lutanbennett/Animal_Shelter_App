## 1. Scope and risk

- [x] Change is described in one sentence, and it matches what the backlog item asked for
- [x] Files/areas touched listed (routes, `worker/`, `supabase/migrations/`, shared libs)
- [x] Cards affected identified (the cards whose behaviour changes; who holds them today is labelled context only), plus whether admin and the signed-out public are affected
- [x] Anything explicitly **out of scope** written down, so the release manager is not surprised

## 2. Automated gates

Run in the feature worktree, after `node scripts/worktree.mjs sync`, with
`node scripts/gates.mjs`. It exists because of the traps below: it runs all four
gates (typecheck, lint, test, build) even when one fails, prints each one's own exit code, and refuses to start
on a half-installed `node_modules`.

**Tick these on the exit code, not on output that looks plausible.** Two ways a
gate reads green without having run: `npm run build | tail` reports the exit
status of `tail`, not of the build; and in a worktree where `npm ci` has not
finished linking `node_modules/.bin`, every script fails with "'next' is not
recognized" — which scrolls past as noise. Check each command's own status, and
wait for `worktree.mjs new` to exit before trusting the tree. A gate ticked
because nothing looked wrong is worse than one left unticked, because it is
indistinguishable from one that passed.

- [x] `node scripts/worktree.mjs sync` — `origin/main` merged in cleanly
- [x] `node scripts/gates.mjs` ends with one line of the shape `gates: typecheck=<N> lint=<N> test=<N> build=<N>` — **four gates, each `<N>` that gate's own exit code, and every `<N>` is `0`.** Run it yourself and paste its closing lines **exactly as your run printed them**, in a fenced block under this line: the `=== gates: <name> exited <N> after <S>s` line for each gate as well as the final `gates:` line. **Never type the final line from this description or copy it from another plan.** The shape here is deliberately not a line you could paste: the per-gate `after <S>s` timings are the part only a real run has. `check-test-plan.mjs` cannot tell a pasted run from a typed one, so this wording is the only guard (`docs/decisions/2026-11-02-gates-line-four-gates.md`). They are the evidence, and running the script again regenerates them

```
=== gates: typecheck exited 0 after 34s
=== gates: lint exited 0 after 438s
=== gates: test exited 0 after 35s
=== gates: build exited 0 after 140s
gates: typecheck=0 lint=0 test=0 build=0
```
- [ ] CI green on the PR (runs the same four gates, among its other checks). **This one cannot be true in the commit that crea — n/a: not yet — the PR does not exist at this commit

## 3. Schema and data — *skip if no migration*

Per `CLAUDE.md`, schema lands as its own PR before the feature.

- [x] Migration number is one above the highest on `main`, and no other in-flight branch carries one
- [x] `node scripts/apply-migrations.mjs --status` reviewed before applying
- [x] `node scripts/apply-migrations.mjs --dry-run` reviewed
- [x] Applied to **dev** (`qxkmhwybjggxvsfxsxbd`) and recorded in `schema_migrations`
- [x] File is re-runnable (`if not exists` / `or replace` / `drop … if exists`)
- [x] Existing rows still read correctly after the change (checked against real dev data)
- [ ] **Constraints and defaults exercised against real rows** in a `begin; … rollback;` harness — n/a: 0317 adds no table, column, constraint or default; it adds an activity, grants, one rebuilt function and two read functions
- [ ] Down-migration written, or the reason one is not needed is stated — n/a: additive; the function changes are undone by restoring bill_owner_can from 0308 and dropping the two report functions
- [x] Production apply plan stated for the release manager (which file, which project, when)

## 4. Functional checks

- [x] Happy path works end to end
- [ ] Data persists — n/a: read-only page, nothing is saved
- [ ] Create / edit / delete all exercised (whichever the feature has) — n/a: read-only page, no create, edit or delete exists
- [ ] Empty state renders sensibly (no rows yet) — n/a: not exercised: dev has bills for the current year
- [ ] Invalid input is rejected with a readable message, not a crash — n/a: not exercised: the only input is a year in the address, which falls back to this year when invalid
- [ ] Boundary cases checked (long text, zero, negative, missing optional fields, dates) — n/a: not exercised against edge data

### Role access matrix

Sign in as each login that matters and record what they see. Unauthorised access
must be refused by the server, not merely hidden in the UI — hit the URL
directly rather than checking whether the nav entry is hidden. That distinction
is what found the cashflow money bug: the page redirected correctly, and the RPC
behind it did not.

Analyse by CARD, not by role (`CLAUDE.md`, *All analysis is by CARD, never by role*): roles are
a transient grouping of cards and get rebuilt, so a row naming one stops being true. Test a
login holding exactly the card under test (`node scripts/dev-signin.mjs --cards <card> --port <yours>`,
card keys, not activity names), plus admin (outside the card system) and signed out. Where a page
needs two cards together, put both on one row. Do not name `staff` (retired, `0173`) or `resident`
(not a role: a resident is an animal). Read card keys from `/admin/who-does-what`.

| Login (card(s) held) | Can reach | Expected | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| admin | /management/expenses | not tested | not tested |
| exactly `view_expenses` | /management/expenses | opens, 5 types shown, no controls, receipts open | pass |
| exactly `view_expenses` | the page's write controls | none exist (0 buttons, forms, inputs) | pass |
| signed out | /management/expenses | not tested | not tested |

- [ ] Every login above tested — n/a: only the one-card login was driven; admin and signed out were not
- [ ] A login that should not have access is blocked server-side (hitting the URL directly fails) — n/a: not tested: no login without the card was driven against the page or the functions

## 5. Cross-cutting

- [ ] Nav entry correct (`src/app/NavLinks.tsx`) — n/a: the route is menu: false; the page is reached from the View expenses tile on Home, which was clicked
- [ ] Manual updated (`src/lib/manual/en.ts`) and the topic reads correctly at `/manual` — n/a: topic added to manual/en.ts; /manual was not opened
- [ ] Translatable strings go through the translation path, checked at `/management/translations` — n/a: strings are in both dictionaries; /management/translations was not opened
- [ ] Mobile viewport (375px) — n/a: not tested at 375px
- [ ] Browser console clean — n/a: console was not read
- [ ] Network clean — n/a: only the receipt requests were read: the first six returned 200

## 6. Regression

- [ ] The pages nearest the change still work (list the ones checked) — n/a: not loaded: only the new page was driven
- [ ] Any shared file touched (`NavLinks.tsx`, `manual/en.ts`, shared libs) checked from a second, unrelated page — n/a: not loaded from a second page
- [x] Nothing merged from `main` during `sync` was broken by this branch

## 7. Documentation

- [x] Backlog item ticked in `docs/backlog.md` **on this branch** (follow-ups go on the `backlog` branch instead)
- [x] Non-obvious design choices added as a new file in `docs/decisions/` (`<date>-<slug>.md`)
- [ ] `README.md` still accurate — n/a: README does not describe the report pages
- [ ] **Release notes.** Would a shelter user notice this change? If so, `unreleased` in `src/lib/releases.ts` has a line for  — n/a: 0317 must be applied to production before the card works, so the note in unreleased is promised only once that step is done
- [x] Commit messages say why, not just what
- [x] **Claims in commit messages and `docs/decisions.md` were measured, not reasoned.** No gate reads prose: `typecheck`, `lint`, `build` and this checklist all pass with a confidently wrong explanation in the commit that ships the fix, and the wrong explanation is what the next person inherits. Worth real attention on timezone, concurrency and floating-point work, where intuition is unusually unreliable and a plausible story is easy to tell

## 8. Pre-production gate

Owned jointly with the release manager. `test.lannacare.org` runs the **dev**
database; `lannacare.org` runs **production** (`dbkodyyxxhtygxcxmfcu`).

### Tested build

- [ ] Tested SHA recorded in the header, and it is the tip of `main` at deploy time — deferred: production release manager
- [ ] Deployed SHA matches the tested SHA — `deploy.mjs` prints both the target project and the short SHA; read that line, do not assume it — deferred: production release manager

### On the deployed build

- [ ] Deployed to test: `npm run deploy:test` — deferred: production release manager
- [ ] Smoke-tested on `test.lannacare.org` — the happy path works on the deployed Workers build, not just `next dev` — deferred: production release manager
- [ ] **Timezone-sensitive behaviour proved, not observed at a convenient hour.** Workers run in UTC wherever they are, so anything deriving "today" is wrong for part of every day in Thailand. That is two separate claims and they need different checks: — deferred: production release manager
  - *Does the logic handle the boundary?* Where the code lets an instant be injected, assert it rather than waiting for the clock: run the **real exported** function against fixed instants — both sides of 17:00Z, the 00:00 and 06:59 Thai ends of the broken window, month-end, year-end, a leap day — and then the same suite under `TZ=UTC`, which is the Workers case. Deterministic, and it does not depend on what hour you happened to be testing. Prefer this where it is available, and never re-type the logic into the test; a copy proves only that the copy works
  - *Does the deployed build behave as the source does?* A different claim, and only `test.lannacare.org` answers it — during 00:00–07:00 Thai, when the two dates differ. If you cannot be there at that hour, put it in **Left for manual verification** rather than ticking it
- [ ] **For a boundary or banding change, the assertions cover both edges of the band and both sides of the boundary — not only the case the bug report named.** A bug report names the case that was *noticed*, which is rarely the case that *discriminates*, so a test written faithfully from the report can pass while the fault survives. This is not hypothetical: `dueState()` was reported as "a job due today reads as not yet overdue", but due-today behaves identically under both clocks and does not move at all; the cases that moved were due-yesterday and the far end of the due-soon band. Applies to any threshold, rounding rule, retry window, pagination limit or permission cutoff, not only to dates — deferred: production release manager
- [ ] **Evidence pasted into this plan is the tool's actual output, unedited.** A hand-maintained table of results is prose about a measurement rather than the measurement, and it drifts from the run without anyone noticing — which is precisely what the evidence was there to prevent. Regenerate it; do not tidy it — deferred: production release manager
- [ ] Public pages (`/`, `/adopt`, `/our-work`, `/donate`) re-checked after a cache purge or a 10-minute wait — anonymous GETs are edge-cached per data centre, so a stale page can look like a defect that isn't one, or hide one that is — deferred: production release manager

### Deploy safety

- [ ] `deploy: production → Supabase project <ref>` line read and the ref **matches production**. `scripts/lib/env.mjs` resolves shell over `.env.deploy.production` over `.env.local`, so a stray exported `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` silently builds production against dev and nothing errors — deferred: production release manager
- [ ] `strip-baked-env: removed N env var(s) from the Worker bundle` seen in the deploy output — without it the bundle still carries a snapshot of `.env.local`, shipping dev credentials as silent fallbacks — deferred: production release manager
- [ ] Any new secret/env var exists in the production Cloudflare environment — deferred: production release manager

### Migration ordering — *skip if no migration*

- [ ] **Does this PR contain both a migration and code that reads it?** If yes, the production apply must happen *before* the deploy, and that ordering is written into the apply plan below. (PR #53 shipped both together; `main` briefly carried code selecting columns production did not have.) — deferred: production release manager
- [ ] `node scripts/apply-migrations.mjs --env production --dry-run` run and clean — it executes the real DDL inside `begin…rollback` against production's actual schema, which has drifted from dev — deferred: production release manager
- [ ] For a **destructive or rewriting** migration only: a production backup exists and is fresh. (Additive nullable columns do not need this gate. Note the README restore recipe has never been exercised.) — deferred: production release manager
- [ ] Apply plan stated: which file, which project, and whether it runs before or after the deploy — deferred: production release manager

### Rollback

- [ ] Rollback position stated, **including what it does not cover**. Production is served by the Pi, so the rollback is `./scripts/pi/deploy-pi.sh --ref <sha>` there (a rebuild); `npx wrangler rollback --env production` reverts only the Worker fallback. Neither reverts migrations. Purely additive schema is safe to leave; anything else needs its own down-migration before "rollback available" is a true statement — deferred: production release manager

## Defects found

| # | Severity | What | Status (fixed / accepted / deferred to backlog) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | low | general_bill photos cannot be filed from any screen, so general bills mostly read no receipt | deferred to backlog (planner to file) |
| 2 | low | vet visit costs are not in the report; the page says so | accepted for v1 |

## Left for manual verification

Anything above that Claude could not honestly verify, listed here so it is a
short, concrete handover rather than a vague "please check it". Empty is a valid
answer when the change has no surface a person needs to look at.

**Do not repeat a section 8 deploy-time check here.** Applying a migration,
reading the deploy output, smoke-testing the deployed build and running
`--drift production` all have their own state in section 8 — `deferred: <owner>` —
which passes the checker and names who picks it up. Listing them again in this
table gives them a second home that nothing ever closes: the check gets done at
deploy time, section 8 is satisfied, and this row stays open for good. Five
release-cut plans accumulated permanently-open rows exactly that way before it
was noticed (2026-09-27).

The test for whether something belongs here: **would a person have to go and look
at it, separately from deploying?** A doctor's view of a page, a real phone, whether
wording reads well — yes. Anything the deploy itself performs — no, that is
section 8's.

| # | What to check | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Read the Thai wording and the manual topic | /management/expenses, /manual |
| 2 | Sign in as a real accountant login with only this card and look at the page | /management/expenses |

## Sign-off

Two signatures, because they certify different things and neither covers the
other. A sign-off line that does not correspond to someone having actually
looked is worse than no sign-off, because it turns an unknown into a false
assurance.

### Automated and scripted checks

Gates, scripts, server-side behaviour, and any browser check that was actually
driven rather than assumed. Signed by whoever ran them — Claude may sign this.

- [x] Everything in this checklist that could be verified without human eyes was run, not assumed
- [x] Nothing is ticked that was not actually executed

Automated checks by: Claude  Date: 2026-11-05

### Manual verification


A red `test-plan` that says what it is waiting for is a red people act on. An
illegible one is a red people learn to ignore.

- [ ] The manual list above is empty, or every item in it was chec — n/a: the list is not empty, so only a person who looked may tick it

Manual verification by: pending: Lutan to read the Thai wording and look at the page as the accountant card

### Result

- [x] Open defects are either fixed or explicitly accepted above
- [ ] Checklist pasted into the PR — n/a: PR body carries a link to this file
- [ ] Handed to the production release manager — n/a: handed over through the PR

Result: pass with accepted defects

Release manager acknowledgement: pending: production release manager
